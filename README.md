# CS-210-SNHU
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was intended to create a formatted set of clocks. One was a 12 hour clock and one was a 24 hour clock. The code is designed to allow a user to add and hour   a minute or a second to each clock.
What did you do particularly well?
  I built the time class well. Makinging sure that the time did not exceed the limit for each measurement (12/24 for the hours) (59 for the minutes and seconds). I made   clean simple code that worked well. I do not think it could have been done with less lines. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  While i do not think it would be more efficient, The lines used for formatting the clocks could be improved upon. The output looks nice put the code could be cleaned     up
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found the formatting to be the most difficult. I attempted a few different techniques to get it to work but ultimately ended up with a mess code that managed an       acceptable output. I had the tools to do this but I had put myself on a time constraint that limited my overall perfection of this. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The use of classes and linking them to the main code is defenitly transferable. Using a case switch along with classes is very beneficial for many applications as       well. The exploration of different formatting techniques will be helpful too even if I did     not use them entierly in this project.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added many notes for what everything is intended to do. Additionally the use of classes makes the code more adjustable and maintainable. Adding to the class, or       adjusting the current class would not be difficult. Because the "main menu" is set up as a case switch it is easy to add any number of functions with out messing the     rest of the code up.
